#Build with Neura 
Neura provides context. We distill raw data into contextual knowledge so that developers can make **smarter** apps and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  

###Neura is ready for you to build awesome apps
You can use the Neura API and SDKs to securely access user data by subscribing to PUSH events or submitting a PULL request for a data object.  User privacy is critical to us, so we ensure that users have approved your access to their data with OAuth2 authentication.

#Internal Neura notes 
Mikimer has moved the API and SDK docs from Word to Github to (1) make it easier to collaborate, (2) improve formatting and readability, and (3) to create an MVP that's ready for public release.

Plans:  
- Mikimer will own this document until further notice
- Anyone else editing the doc will submit change to Mikimer for approval
- Mikimer will flag Issues for team members to address  
- 

The source documents were:  
  - NEURA.ME API Integration Guide ver 2.docx    
  - NEURA.ME Android Integration Guide.docx  
  - NEURA ME iOS Integration Guide.docx

Throughout the document **I've embedded bold text with questions for whoever wrote the original text**.  I'm planning on sitting down with the tech team to get answers to these questions when I'm in Israel Nov 30th to Dec 12th 2014.  I'd LOVE IT if you forked the original documents and responded to these questions.  Eroc quickly became a master of the fork and pull request, so I'm confident the tech team can do it too, hehe ;)

Conventions:  
- states - instantaneous (1 sec?) moment where Neura returns where the user is / what they're doing PULL **Next step: Berman to chat w/ Ori about distinguishing between States & Events.**
- events - change in state PUSH
- data objects - dataset for the user during a period of time PULL
