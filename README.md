#Build with Neura 
[Internet-of-things (IoT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) devices generate too much raw data to be useful; your users might have an activity tracker or smart home detection system, but it's a pain for you to make use of the raw data.  Neura's artificial intelligence (AI) engine solves this big-data problem by distilling contextual knowledge and actionable insights. Neura enables your apps and IoT devices to be **smarter**.  

###Neura is ready for you to build awesome apps
You can use the Neura API and SDKs to securely access user data by subscribing to events or requesting insights.  User privacy is critical to us, so users must approve your access to their data with OAuth2 authentication.
