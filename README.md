#Build with Neura 

We're excited for you to join the community of Builders using Neura to enhance their apps and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  


###The Neura API is ready for you to build amazing apps.  
You can use the Neura API to securely access user data by subscribing to PUSH events or submitting a PULL request for a data object.  The Neura API is **read-only(?)**, requires HTTPS, and returns responses in JSON.  User privacy is very important to us, so we use OAuth2 authentication to ensure that users have approved your access to their data.

The API is currently in alpha, so we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve it.  We will do our best to give you at least 10-days notice before releasing breaking changes and to constantly communicate the [status of the API]().
