#Build with Neura 
Neura provides context. We distill raw data into contextual knowledge so that you can make **smarter** apps and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  

###Neura is ready for you to build awesome apps
You can use the Neura API and SDKs to securely access user data by subscribing events or requesting a data object.  User privacy is critical to us, so we ensure that users have approved your access to their data with OAuth2 authentication.
