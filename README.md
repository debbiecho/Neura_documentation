#Build with Neura 

We're excited for you to join the community of developers using Neura to enhance their apps and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  

###The Neura API is ready for you to build awesome apps.  
You can use the Neura API and SDKs to securely access user data by subscribing to PUSH events or submitting a PULL request for a data object.  User privacy is critical to us, so we use OAuth2 authentication to ensure that users have approved your access to their data.
