#Devices that integrate with Neura

Users can send data to Neura from the following devices.  If you would like an integration that doesn't appear below, please let us know at build [at] theneura [dot] com.

Please note:  
* **Integrations are read-only**. Neura does not write data to integrated devices. If you want Neura to write data to your app or IoT device, [begin here](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/blob/master/text/basics.md).   
* **Users manually onboard integrated devices**.  If your users have any of Neura's integrated devices, please encourage them to onboard those devices to Neura so that Neura can provide you with the best possible service.  
* **Neura only considers data from one activity tracker per day**. Neura considers users with multiple activity trackers to be an [edge case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case). Consequently, for users with multiple activity trackers, Neura uses data from the activity tracker with the highest quality data available for that day.
