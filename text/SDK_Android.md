#Neura SDK for Android

You can add the Neura SDK for Android to your app to that your app can request PUSH event notifications and issue PULL requests for data objects.  Your users will need to install the Neura app on their phones, available in Google Play `google play link` **add link**.  Once your users have installed the Neura app, they'll need to grant you permission to access their events and data objects.


##AuthenticationThe Neura Android SDK has the method `NeuraAuthUtil.authenticate` that handles authentication flow, which consists of two steps:
1.	The method verifies whether the Neura app is installed on the user's phone and returns a boolean value.
    - If `FALSE` then the method fails. You should prompt the user to download the Neura app. SDK gives util with method that redirects to the app in Google Play. **Do we return boolean or boolean & util?**
    - If `TRUE` then the method proceeds to step 2.
2.	The method opens the authentication flow and prompts the user for authentication credentials and permissions.  **Clarify with Berman**The callback of the method is the authentication result using the `Activity.onActivityResult` method, as detailed in the Android developers guide: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onActivityResult(int, int, android.content.Intent)

Your application can identify the Neura callbacks by using the `requestCode` that was provided in the method `NeuraAuthUtil.authenticate`. In the case of successful authentication retrieve the access token for future events subscription by NeuraAuthUtil.extractToken. Access token is permanent and can be used for subscribing to events in any next steps. Access token is per consumer application and user. The same userâ€™s access token can be used also for Neura API push events subscription and pull services request. In the case of the failure one of the error codes is prompted.
