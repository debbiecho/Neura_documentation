#Quickstart: Subscribe to event PUSH notifications 
In this project you will subscribe to the Neura event PUSH notifications for `userStartedWalking` and `userArrivedHome` for **User XXX**.  This project is only available for Android; it will soon be available for iOS.  This project should take you less than **YY** minutes.

#Mikimer & Berman to discuss
Get the sample app working, sampleProject.apk
how do PUSH notifications work in Neura? 
which user should we pick for User XXX? Can we make a simple robot that spends 30 seconds idle followed by 30 seconds not idle?
