#Neura SDK for iOS


[![Neura iOS SDK](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/blob/master/resources/iOS-7-SDK-icon.png)](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/tree/master/resources/Neura_iOS_SDK)


You can add the Neura SDK for iOS to your app so that your app can request PUSH event notifications and issue requests for data objects from Neura.  Your users will need to install the [app by requesting access to be a Neura beta tester on TestFlight](https://theneura.prefinery.com/betas/4631/testers/new?display=inline&version=2).  Once your users have installed the Neura app, they'll need to grant you permission to access their events and data objects.
