#Quickstart: Authenticate with Neura's demo 3rd Party App on iOS
In this project you will authenticate with the Neura to receive your unique `accessToken` so that you can request your own data from Neura.  [Instructions](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/blob/master/text/quickstart_iOS.md#instructions) for this project are detailed below -- it should take you less than 10 minutes, if you've already set up your Neura account; it **requires an account** with Neura and an iOS phone.  

This project demonstrates Neura's ability to notify a 3rd party app of user events. A practical application of this project is that you can use it to develop an app that intelligently reacts to your users' actions in real time.  

_Note: Event subscriptions are [available for Android](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/blob/master/text/quickstartPush.md). We're currently building them for iOS._

##Instructions

###1. Install the apps
You must have both the [Neura app](https://theneura.prefinery.com/betas/4631/testers/new?display=inline&version=2) and the [3rd party demo app](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/tree/master/resources/Neura_iOS_demo_app) for this project.

####Be sure to activate your account with Neura.   
If you need the password to access the Neura app, contact us at build [at] theneura [dot] com and be sure to note that you're working on this project. Your Neura app should look similar to this:

###2. Operate the 3rd party demo app
Launch the 3rd party demo app and click `Authenticate with Neura`.  Neura will return your unique `accessToken`. Copy the `accessToken` for future use.

###3. Take it for a spin
Use your `accessToken` in the project [Quickstart: request wellness information for a user](https://github.com/NeuraLabs/Neura_documentation/blob/master/text/quickstartPull.md) to see your own information.

##Congrats on finishing the quickstart project! 
We hope it gives you a small taste of the power of Neura and motivates you to integrate your apps and IoT devices with Neura.
