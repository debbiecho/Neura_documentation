**Tech considerations**

Developers provide Neura with:
  - Need to have
    - email
    - password
    - existing User? Best practices is to use the same email for User & Dev accounts, similar to Google & Facebook.
    - Which platform will you develop for? Select all that apply: Android, iOS, web


Let's address data portability. What happens if they leave Neura? https://www.braintreepayments.com/features

**Biz considerations**

  - Need to know
    - 
  - Want to know
    - For v5 CRM: Who is at the company? Do they want to be users? devs? Make it easy to send them invitations.

    
   - **how to manage community?**

  - Make sure to include data privacy. Just because Neura send a developer data (state, event, data object) can't mean that the developer owns that data indefinitely.
